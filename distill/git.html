<h2>Branch and Merge</h2>
A new branch (task-1) is created from master. Notice that everytime the branch is switched (checkout),
the content is changed respectively, and the timestamp is always updated to the latest time,
which is essential for program building.

<h2>$GIT_DIR</h2>
$GIT_DIR can be used when repository and working directories are separated
(in normal senario, repoistiory locates in .git of the top working directory).
In the following example, we check out different branches in different working directory
using the same repository.
<pre>

jzou@luigi ~/rnd/git/branch $ <b>export GIT_DIR=/home/jzou/rnd/git/work/.git</b>

Because the same repository is shared by two working directories, there's no benefit

supposed to merge automatically, however since nothing is merged, no file is changed either.
