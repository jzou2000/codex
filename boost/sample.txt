Registering the Java plug-in (Linux only)

If you plan to launch the Exceed onDemand client on a Linux platform, you
must register the libnpjp2.so plug-in file so that your Web browser can
detect and use the Java version installed on your computer.

To register the <b>Java</b> plug-in on Linux:
1 Close your <b>Web browser</c> if it is running.
2 Start a terminal session.
3 At a command prompt, go to the plugins directory located in the
directory in which your Web browser is installed (for example, /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins for Mozilla Firefox and /opt/google/chrome/plugins for Google Chrome).
4 Run the following command to create a symbolic link to the libnpjp2.so file:
    ln -s <JRE_installation_path>/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so

Your Web browser is now configured to use the Java plug-in.
